# **Estimating the Effect of Self-Service Bans in the Retail Gasoline Market on Gasoline Prices**

### Background:

In 1968, 23 states had banned the self-service sale of gasoline. By 1992, most of these states had repealed the ban. Only New Jersey and Oregon continued to ban self-service sales after 1992 and kept this regulation in place until Jan 1st 2018 when Oregon allowed the self-service retail of gasoline in counties with population below 40,000 people. 

### Theoretical Prediction:

Using a simple model of supply and demand, we predict that revoking the self-service ban will lead to a reduction in gasoline prices aa a consequence of increasing marginal costs of gasoline stations. 

### Objective:

This paper examines the impact of revoking gasoline self-service bans on the price of gasoline of affected Oregon counties. 

### Methods:

We support this prediction empirically using a difference-in-differences model comparing the counties where the self-service ban was revoked to the ones that remained unaffected.

### Software Utilized:

Stata and ArcGIS.

### Results:

Our full model shows that revoking the self-service ban reduced gasoline prices by about eight cents per gallon. All of our results show a negative and statistically significant impact on gasoline prices.

### Conclusion:

These results show a substantial negative impact of self-service bans in gasoline markets and are fundamental for the policy debate over whether to keep these laws in Oregon and New Jersey.
